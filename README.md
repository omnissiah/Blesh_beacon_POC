This is the mobile part of a simple IOT Hackathon POC, using blesh beacons to push/pull data for charity purposes. It can be repurposed to fit any charity IOT or cloud concepts mobile part.

Issues
- Banking Integration presumed but not implemented: No API access.
- Only Ibeacons or blesh searched.
- Only Beacon MajorID of 1 is filtered due to blesh restrictions.
